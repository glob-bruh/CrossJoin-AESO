# CrossJoin-AESO Discord Bot

### Prelude:
This is my first experience using both the discord.py library to make a basic discord app as well as my first time utilizing the AESO API. In essence what it currently does is let you say !CrossJoin then type a command and sometimes extension to run a command that the bot uses to call the API and process it into usable information.

### How to use:

#### Setting up .env:
- Create `.env` file in project root. 
- Add the following values to your file:
  - `DISCORD_KEY`: Required to connect with your bot on Discord. You can find this on the [applications section of the Discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
  - `AESO_API_KEY`: Required for using AESO API. You can sign-up and get your API key on the [AESO developers portal](https://developer-apim.aeso.ca/).
  - `AB_511_KEY`: Required for using Alberta 511 API. You can sign-up and request a key by making a [511 account](https://511.alberta.ca/my511/register). For now, all 511 content is best-effort, and has not been tested. 
  
> [!WARNING]
> Alberta 511 key registration is substantially more involved than other services. You will be required to provide an valid email and phone number (you will be asked to confirm them), forced to consent to receiving travel information via SMS (with [opt-out options](https://511.alberta.ca/about/privacy)), and then required to send a text-based reason for accessing the API. You can remove your phone number after registration on the ["my account" page](https://511.alberta.ca/my511/account).

#### Docker (recommended):
- Run `docker compose --env-file ./.env up`.

#### Systemd:
- Place or link the file located at `./config/CrossJoin.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- If you are using `venv`, make sure to change the python executable location in `ExecStart`.

#### Using the bot: 
- Add the bot to your server.
- Bot supports Discord command notation (`/` commands). 
- Run `/help` for help.

### Future Additions:
- [x] Add in graph and chart visualizations.
- [x] Switch to using the discord `/` command notation.
- [ ] Cleanup and refinement of some parts of the system.
- [ ] Cleanup UI, further integrate into discords modern bot UI standards.
- [x] Integrate road reports into the bot if possible through their APIs.
  - [x] 511 Alberta.
    - [ ] Add option in bot configuration to disable 511 commands in the event that user is unable to acquire dev-key.
    - [x] 511 Cameras.
    - [x] 511 Road conditions.

### Contributing Guidelines:
1) Check to see if something you would like to add already has a feature branch. If it does then go and get involved in the conversation there to see if your ideas can be implemented.
2) If there is an addition you would like to make to the bot, feel free to start making a feature branch and explain the purpose of that feature in the branch.
